<h2>About</h2>
<p>
JSON Formatter & Validator is a small, fast, client-side tool built for practical debugging: API payloads, config files,
webhook events, and data exports. The goal is simple: help you get to a <em>valid</em>, readable JSON result quickly,
with clear error location and real troubleshooting steps—not vague advice.

This site is intentionally lightweight (no tracking-heavy frameworks). For extremely sensitive data, we still recommend using a clean browser profile
and minimizing extensions that can read page content.
